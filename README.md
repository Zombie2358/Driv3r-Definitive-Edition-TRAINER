//DRIV3R DEFINITIVE EDITION TRAINER\\

Driv3r Definitive Edition Trainer contains two versions (Tiny and Regular version). Tiny version requires you to have Cheat Engine installed while the regular version doesn't.
HOWEVER, The regular version gets flagged as a false positive Trojan since it contains CheatEngine dlls that get executed once ran. It is safe to enable and won't give you a virus!


Activate Trainer by pressing F1 once you load your Driv3r profile!
